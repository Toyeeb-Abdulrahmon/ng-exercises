    <h1>Problem</h1>
    <p>
      Alfie was a prisoner in mythland. Though Alfie was a witty and intelligent
      guy.He was confident of escaping prison.After few days of observation,He
      figured out that the prison consists of <code>(N x N)</code> cells.i.e The
      shape of prison was <code>(N x N)</code> matrix. Few of the cells of the
      prison contained motion detectors.So Alfie planned that while escaping the
      prison he will avoid those cells containing motion detectors.Yet before
      executing his plan,Alfie wants to know the total number of unique possible
      paths which he can take to escape the prison.Initially Alfie is in cell
      <code>(1, 1)</code> while the exit of the cell <code>(N x N)</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      note:->Alfie can move in all four direction if his current location is
      <code>(X, Y)</code>, he can move to either:
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>(X + 1, Y)</code>, <code>(X - 1, Y)</code>, <code>(X, Y + 1)</code>,
      <code>(X, Y - 1)</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the first cell <code>(1, 1)</code> or the last cell<code>(N, N)</code>
      contain motion detectors,then Alfie can't break out of the prison.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>INPUT:</strong>
    </p>

    Provide the Matrix with separated values either 0 or 1. "1" represents a
    cell containing motion detectors.

    output total number of unique possible paths which he can take to escape the
    prison.
